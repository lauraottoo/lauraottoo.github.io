        <dt>Painting</dt>
        <dd>Since I was a kid I love crafting, drawing and painting, but I don't paint as much as I did when I was younger.</dd>
        <dd>In many of the gifts I hav given to people, there is always some kind of craft or painting made by me.</dd>
        <dd>I made this painting and flower bottle at the pet therapy fair in SMC:</dd>

        <dt>TV shows and movies</dt>
        <dd>TV shows and movies are one of my favorite activities to do alone or with friends. It is my time to relax, eat, be comfy and escape from reality for a while.</dd>
        <dd>I am currently watching Greys Anatomy.</dd>

        <dt>Graphic design & marketing</dt>
        <dd>I enjoy looking at marketing communication strategies of different companies, specially looking at their ads. I analyze the creativity behind those ads, and consider them good or bad.</dd>
        <dd>Although I don't study graphic design, I love designing presentations, flyers, logos, posters and everything related. Here are some of the designs I made:</dd>

        <dt>Going to the beach</dt>
        <dd>In my town back in Spain we have a beautiful beach. I go more during the summer, but sometimes I go during the winter as well. I love how connected I feel with nature when I go, and you can do many activities there as well!</dd>
        <dd>The beach below is two hours away from my hometown.</dd>
