<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>My favourite courses I have ever taken were Modern Social Thought, Marketing Management, Accounting and Cross cultural Management. These courses have helped me to debate the power of new technologies, practice how to make a good marketing strategy, learn the basics of accounting and understand how culture plays a big role in business. I didn't like math, business law and operations because the content was not interesting or the teacher didn't make the classes dynamic. On the third year of my major, I can say I feel more prepared to start my own business some day.
